<p>Hello! Welcome to this tutorial. We’re going to learn about how a computer can use HUGE amounts of data and make cool graphs from it.</p>
<p>Today we’ll get to learn about fish crossings at dams in the Columbia River.</p>
<p>We’ll start by looking at the Bonneville Dam and learn how many salmon and steelhead cross the Bonneville dam each year.</p>

<p>The Bonneville Dam is in the Columbia River and was constructed between 1933 and 1938. When it was constructed, it had a large impact on the surrounding land, Indigenous communities, and animals and plants.</p>
<div class="border-left">
<p><strong>Brainstorm:</strong></p>
<p><em>What are some positive and negative impacts you think the dam might have?</em></p>
<p>Talk with your classmates about how some impacts the dam might have on the surronding areas. Here are some ideas you can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydropower</li>
<li>Native American communities</li>
<li>Salmon populations</li>
<li>Salmon are important spiritually and culturally to Native Americans</li>
<li>Sea lions</li>
<li>Other animals who live where the dam was created</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-the-bonneville-dam-impact-salmon">How does the Bonneville Dam impact Salmon?</h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we’re going to look at <strong>data</strong> and learn about how the dam impacts Salmon <strong>returning</strong> to the Columbia river to spawn.</p>
<p>First, how are fishing swimming through the Bonneville Dam?</p>
<p>It is way to large for them to swim over, so they use a <strong>fish ladder</strong> to swim through the dam. Someone built the fish ladder when they were building the dam to help the fish get through! Watch this video to see how they can swim through the fish ladder.</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sabk7Khq0kQ" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>As salmon come through the fish ladder, they need to be counted to see how many salmon come through and learn how many make it through the dam and return upstream to spawn. Some days, thousands of fish come through the dam! How do you think they are counted?</p>
<p>Watch this video to see!</p>
<div class="quarto-video ratio ratio-16x9"><iframe data-external="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoHpE5scs2I" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
<p>As you saw in the video, someone counts each fish that goes by. They write down exactly how many fish they see, what time and what kind of fish. All those numbers get added together and become <strong>data</strong>. Then, someone puts all that data <a href="https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/adult_daily" target="_blank">online</a> for anyone to see (like us!).</p>
<p>There is A LOT of data (numbers of fish) that they collect. It would be pretty pretty hard to understand just by looking at it. In fact, if you click the blue box right below this, you can see all the data. It should look pretty confusing! Keep reading to learn how we can use the computer to better understand all those numbers.</p>

<p>We’re going to analyze all the numbers that are collected at the Bonneville Dam using the computer.</p>
<section id="using-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-r">Using R</h3>
<p>We will use a coding language called “R”. Basically, “R” is a collection of commands that the computer understands. You can tell the computer one of the commands and it will know to do something.</p>
<p>For example one command the computer knows is multiplication! Try typing <code>5*3</code> in the box right below this. Then click the green play button that says “run code”</p>

<p>What happened? Did you see the number 15 pop out?</p>
<p>The computer can also do very complicated things, like create graphs. We’ll learn more about that later in this tutorial.</p>
<p>The box above where you typed <code>5*3</code> is called a <strong>code chunk</strong>. You can type commands into any similar box and it will tell the computer to do various things.</p>
<p>Here’s another code chunk you can try typing something into. Maybe you want to try a division problem? Or maybe you want the computer to say hello to you? There’s a few different tabs you can click on to learn how to do cool things!</p>

<p>Would you like the computer to say hello to you?</p>
<p>First, type your name where the blank _______ is, in the second code chunk. Don’t delete the quotation marks.</p>

<p>We can use r to find the largest number in a long list of numbers. To try this out, type a bunch of numbers inside the parentheses (______). Separate your numbers with a comma. Don’t delete anything else!</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<div id="qwebr-insertion-location-9"></div>

<p>Now you try. Type your numbers after the first parenthesis and separate them with a comma. Then click run.</p>

<p>One thing the computer is very useful for is dealing with HUGE amounts of data. <strong>Data</strong> is a collection of lots of numbers that tell us information about something.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the data that is collected at the Bonneville Dam. I’ve used coding in the background of this tutorial to make it a little more condensed than the data you saw before. Want to look at it? Click the blue box below.</p>

<p>Were you able to figure out the maximum number of fish that crossed the Bonneville Dam in one day in 2021? It was probably pretty annoying to have to look through all the numbers…</p>
<p>Luckily, the computer can make this task much easier! Try running the code below. It will find the maximum number in 2021. If you want to learn more about how it works, click the “Learn more” tab.</p>

<p>What if you wanted to know how many <strong>total</strong> fish crossed the dam this year, compared to 50 years ago? We can use the computer to answer that question too!</p>
<div class="border-left">
<p>Brainstorm</p>
<p>First, let’s make a prediction. Think about what you’ve learned about dams and how they impact fish trying to get past them.</p>
<p>Do you think there are <strong>more</strong> fish or <strong>less</strong> fish in 2022 compared to 1972 (50 years before)? Talk to your neighbor about your predictions!</p>
</div>
<p>When you’re ready to check your answer, run the code below. It will find the <strong>sum</strong> of the rows with 2022 data and 1972 data.</p>
