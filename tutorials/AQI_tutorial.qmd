## Introduction

Welcome to this lesson on air quality! We'll be using **data science** to learn about **air quality**. This tutorial will introduce coding to help you better understand air quality. Advance through the tutorial by clicking the blue "Continue" buttons. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to create your own graph of air quality! 

<div class="tutorial-part" style="display: block;">

First, let's learn about air quality. Check out this video to learn more about how air quality affects us.

## Data Science

What is data? 

-   Data is large amounts of information that you collect. Often, it looks like a lot of numbers that are collected to describe some phenomenon. 

-   For example, if you measure the temperature every day in one location for one year, you would have created **data**. You can then use **data science** to analyze that data. 

What is data science? 

-   Data science is the ability to synthesize **data** and derive meaningful information. Often, graphs, maps, models, and charts are used to help understand data and display information.

## Using the computer to do data science 

In this tutorial, we're going to use coding to analyze large amounts of data. We'll be able to create graphs by writing code. 

We're going to use a coding language called **R**. Basically, "R" is a collection of commands that the computer understands. You can tell the computer one of the commands and it will know to do something.

### Introduction to R

This tutorial lets you use R to work with data. Throughout the tutorial, there are gray boxes with a green "run code" button. These are called code chunks. You can type commands into these boxes and it will output answers. Let's try it out.

One command the computer knows is multiplication! Try typing `5*3` in the box right below this. Then **press** the green play button that says "run code".

::: panel-tabset

## Code editor

```{webr-r}
# Type your code here!


```

## Answer

**Press** run code

```{webr-r}
# Type your code here!
5*3

```
:::

Did you see the number 15 pop out?

Here's another code chunk you can try typing something into. Maybe you want to try a division problem? Or maybe you want the computer to say hello to you? There's a few different tabs you can click on to learn how to do cool things!

::: panel-tabset
## Code editor

Want to try out your own code? Maybe another math problem? Here's a place to do that. Otherwise click on the tabs to learn something new!

```{webr}
#Type your code here



```

## Say hello

Would you like the computer to say hello to you?

First, type your name where the blank \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is, in the second code chunk. Don't delete the quotation marks.

Here's an example:

```{webr}
#| read-only: true
name = "Olivia"
```

Now your turn. Type your name instead of the blank \_\_\_\_\_ and then click play:

```{webr}
name = "_____"

cat("Hello", name, "How are you today?")

```

## Find the largest number

We can use r to find the largest number in a long list of numbers. To try this out, type a bunch of numbers inside the parentheses (\_\_\_\_\_\_). Separate your numbers with a comma. Don't delete anything else!

Here's an example:

```{webr-r}
#| read-only:true
numbers = c(41, 55, 98, 104, 2, 8)
```

Now you try. **Type** your numbers after the first parenthesis and separate them with a comma. Then **click** run code.

```{webr-r}
numbers = c(_,_,_,_,_,_,)
```

Now let's run a function that will tell us which number is the biggest. **Click** the play button on this code chunk too.

```{webr-r}
max(numbers)
```
:::

### Analyzing data with R

The programming language R can also do very complicated things, like work wiht large amounts of data and create graphs. 

-   You can import data from various sources,clean and process it, perform statistical analyses and generate reports or visualizations

-   We are going to be utilizing the data visualization aspect by creating graphs from a big data set

## Our data

Today, we'll be looking at air quality data [from the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-data-tile-plot). It contains data that was collected nearly every day for 23 years (2000-2023). It calculates the **air quality index** based on the **PM 2.5** levels. 

Click the blue box below to view the data. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Air quality raw data Portland

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
library(knitr)
library(DT)
datatable(portland_AQI)
#kable(portland_AQI)

```
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Air quality raw data Los Angelos

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
library(DT)
datatable(la_AQI)
```
:::

Wow that's a lot of data! It's pretty hard to get any meaningful information from just that table of information. Luckily, we can use R to better understand it and make graphs! 

Before we use R, though, let's try to understand a bit of what's going on. 

-   At the top of the table, there are bolded words. These are column titles and refer to the **variable names** that are collected when measuring air quality. 

-   Underneath the variable names, you'll see individual **entries** for the data. 

-   At the very bottom of the data table, you can click to different pages of data and see how many total entries there are.

**Stop and think**

### Data location

Let's find out exactly where the air quality data was recorded. If you look at the data table, are you able to find all the **locations (sites) in Portland** where they recorded the air quality? 

-   This is a pretty hard task, as it requires you to look through all the data and find all the different site names. Luckily, we can use the computer to quickly check how many locations there are. 

-   The R command `unique()` outputs all the unique data entries in one column. In other words, it will tell us all the **different** entries the Site Name column. 

**Press** run code below. If you want to learn more about the code, click "Learn more"!

::: panel-tabset

## Code editor

```{webr-r}
unique(portland_AQI$Site.Name)
```

## Learn more

The command we used is 
```{r} 
#| eval: false
unique(portland_AQI$Site.Name)
```

-   `portland_AQI` specifies the data we're looking at. In this case, `portland_AQI` is the name of our data frame - it contains all the data in the Portland table you saw above.
      
      -   The name for the Los Angeles data is `la_AQI`. It contains all the data in the Los Angeles table you saw above.

-   The `$` tells R to find a column name. 

-   `Site.Name` is the name of the column we want to look at, as it contains the locations

## Challenge

Can you figure out the names of the Los Angeles locations where they measured air quality data? 

**Edit** the code below so that it outputs Los Angeles site names. 

*Hint:* You'll need to change the part of the code that says `portland_AQI`. What's the name of the Los Angeles data set? 

```{webr-r}
unique(portland_AQI$Site.Name)

```

## Challenge Answer

```{webr-r}
unique(la_AQI$Site.Name)

```
:::

Do you recognize any of the site names? Are any close to where you live?

## Graphing our data

Now that we understand **what** the data table contains, let's try to graph it and better understand what it **means**. 

Our goal is to make a graph of the overall air quality in Portland and Los Angeles by describing how **healthy** or **unhealthy** the air is. 

The EPA defines the following categories based on the air quality index (AQI): 

![From https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/figures/aqilevels.png){fig-align="left" fig-alt="AQI color, description, index values" height="2in"}
We've inputted these values and colors into our code for the graph. 

You may have noticed that if you go to the [EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-data-tile-plot), they have options to generate a graph right there! So why would we make our own graph? Well, they have pretty limited options for what type of graph you can create and what variables you can choose. If we use R (coding), we have lots more options for types of graphs!

### AQI Tile Plot

We'll start by making a *tile plot* for the air quality index (AQI) from 2000-2023. Let's see what the graph looks like for Portland and Los Angeles. Later on, you'll have options to create other types of graphs for more locations.

**Press** run code below.

**Stop and think**

Talk with your neighbor about the graphs!

-   What do you notice?

-   What do you wonder? 

-   What is different between the two graphs? 

        -   Why are they different? 
        
-   What else would you like to know? 

## Customize your own graphs! 

In the next section section, you'll have the options to make more air quality graphs with lots of customizations. You'll be able to make [another tile plot and choose your own location](#sec-tilemylocation) or [make a scatterplot of AQI over time](#sec-scatterplot). 

## Make a tile plot of any county! {#sec-tilemylocation}

What if you wanted to look at the air quality data for another place? You'll be able to do that below.

This data is also [from the EPA](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#AQI), but it has all the counties in the US!


### Choose a county {#sec-choosecounty}

First, you'll need to choose a county that you want to graph. 

Here are your options, organized by state. Click through them and find the county you'd like to graph. You'll need to remember the exact spelling AND capitalization. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## States and County Names

```{r}
#| output: true
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

library(downloader)
url<- "https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/data/aqi_usa_2000_2023.csv.zip"
download(url, dest="dataset.zip", mode="wb") 
usa_aqi_data<- unzip("dataset.zip", exdir = "./")|>
  read.csv()

library(DT)
library(knitr)
usa_aqi_data|>
  select('State.Name','county.Name')|>
  unique()|>
  group_by(State.Name)|>
  datatable()
usa_aqi_data|>
  select('State.Name','county.Name')|>
  unique()|>
  group_by(State.Name)|>
  kable()
```
:::

### Create a tile plot

Now, you'll tell the computer which county you chose.

**Important** make sure you spell the County name exactly as you found it in the table above, and be sure to use proper capitalization as well. 


::: panel-tabset 

## Code editor

**Type** your county name in the code chunk below. Replace the red line with the county but DON'T delete the quotes `""`. 

**Press** Run Code

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "__________"

```

## Example

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "Multnomah"

```
:::

Now we can graph! 

**Press** run code below. 

::: panel-tabset

## Code editor

**Press** run code

```{webr-r}

colLabels <- c('Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy','Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups', 'Very Unhealthy', 'Hazardous')

myColors <- c('seagreen','yellow', 'orange1', 'red','darkmagenta', 'darkred')

aqi_colors<- setNames(object=myColors, nm=colLabels)


myCountyData<- usa_aqi_data|>
  filter(county.Name==myCounty) |>
  mutate(Year=format(as.Date(Date), "%Y"),
        Month = factor(month(Date)),
         DOY = yday(Date))|> 
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels= colLabels)) 
  
  ggplot(myCountyData, aes(x = DOY, y = Year, fill = Category))+
  geom_tile()+
#  scale_y_reverse()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=aqi_colors, drop=FALSE)+
  labs(x="Day of Year", y="Year", title=paste0("AQI levels for ", myCounty))
```

## Troubleshooting

-   Run Code button not working: Make sure you wait until the green circle at the very top of this page says "Ready!" We have some code running in the background and the green circle indicates it has finished running. 

-   Error message: 

    -   Did you accidentally delete or change some code? Click the refresh button at the top of the code cell and try running it again. 
    -   Did you run all the previous code chunks in this section? Return to the code editor where you chose your county name. Make sure you clicked the "Run code" button.
    -   Did you spell and capitalize the County name correctly, exactly as it was found in the table of ["States and County Names"?](#sec-choosecounty)

:::

## Create a scatter plot of AQI over time {#sec-scatterplot}

Next, we're going to graph the number of **days per year** when the AQI was above a certain threshold. 

In other words, we'll graph the number of days when the AQI was red or orange or green or whatever level you choose. Then, we'll see how this **data changes over time**, from 2020 to 2023.

To do this, we'll use a scatterplot. A scatterplot is a collection of points, where each point represents a data value. 

**Stop and Think**

Before we start, what do you think the graph might look like? Discuss these questions with your neighbor: 

-   In Portland, do you think the air quality is getting **better** or **worse** since 2000? 

-   If we only look at **Unhealthy** AQI levels (red) in Portland, do you think there will be **more** or **less** total days of unhealthy air quality since 2000?

### Step 1: Choose your county {#sec-scatterplotstep1}

**Important** make sure you spell the County name exactly as you found it in the table above, and be sure to use proper capitalization as well. 


::: panel-tabset 

## Code editor

**Type** your county name in the code chunk below. Replace the red line with the county but DON'T delete the quotes `""`. 

**Press** Run Code

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "__________"

```

## Example

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "Multnomah"

```
:::

### Step 2: Choose which AQI level you want to graph

Now, you can choose which air quality level you'd like to graph. You can focus on any of the following: 

-   "Good"
-   "Moderate"
-   "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"
-   "Unhealthy"
-   "Very Unhealthy"
-   "Hazardous"

::: panel-tabset

## Code editor

**Type** the level you choose in the code chunk. Replace the red line and be sure to keep the quotes. 

**Press** Run code

```{webr-r}
myLevel = "_______"
```

## Example

```{webr-r}
myLevel = "Unhealthy"
```

:::

### Step 3: Choose a color

Now you can choose a color for your points. Here are a few options. Otherwise go to [this link](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) for more options.

-   "red"
-   "green"
-   "blue"
-   "orange"
-   "pink"
-   "purple"
-   "yellow"

::: panel-tabset

## Code editor

**Type** your color name in the code chunk. Replace the red line. Do not use any capitalization and be sure to keep the quotes `""`.

**Press** run code

```{webr-r}
myColor = "_____"

```

## Example

```{webr-r}
myColor = "red"

```

:::

### Step 4: Create the graph!

Now you can create your graph! 

::: panel-tabset

## Code editor

**Press** run code

```{webr-r}
myScatterplotData<- usa_aqi_data|>
  filter(county.Name==myCounty) |>
  mutate(Year=format(as.Date(Date), "%Y"),
        Month = factor(month(Date)),
         DOY = yday(Date))|> 
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels= colLabels)) |>
  filter(Category == myLevel)

myScatterplotData |>
  group_by(Year) |>
  count() |>
  
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=n, color=myColor))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = paste0("Number of days with AQI value ", myLevel, " 2000-2023"),
       x = "Year",
       y = paste0("Number of days with AQI value ", myLevel))+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))

```

## Add a line of best fit

Want to add a line of best fit? 

**Press** run code.

myScatterplotData<- usa_aqi_data|>
  filter(county.Name==myCounty) |>
  mutate(Year=as.integer(format(as.Date(Date), "%Y")),
        Month = factor(month(Date)),
         DOY = yday(Date))|> 
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels= colLabels)) |>
  filter(Category == myLevel)

myScatterplotData |>
  group_by(Year) |>
  count() |>
  
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=n))+
  geom_point(color=myColor) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', color=myColor)+
  labs(title = paste0("Number of days with AQI value ", myLevel, " 2000-2023"),
       x = "Year",
       y = paste0("Number of days with AQI value ", myLevel))+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))

```

## Troubleshooting

-   Run Code button not working: Make sure you wait until the green circle at the very top of this page says "Ready!" We have some code running in the background and the green circle indicates it has finished running. 

-   Error message: 

    -   Did you accidentally delete or change some code? Click the refresh button at the top of the code cell and try running it again. 
    -   Did you run all the previous code chunks in this section? Return to [Step 1](#sec-scatterplotstep1) and make sure you pressed "Run code" in every step. 
    -   Did you spell and capitalize all the variables correctly, as specified in each step? If not, correct it and press "run code" in that step.

## Code Challenge

Want to change your graph up? Follow the steps below to edit your graph even more!

### Step 1: Choose your location {#sec-challengestep1}

First, you'll tell the computer which county you'd like to graph. 

**Important** make sure you spell the County name exactly as you found it in the table above, and be sure to use proper capitalization as well. 

**Type** the county name in the code chunk below. Replace the red line with the county but DON'T delete the quotes `""`. 

::: panel-tabset 

## Code editor

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "__________"

```

## Example

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "Multnomah"

```
:::

### Step 2: Choose your variables

Next, you can decide whether you want to view the data by **month** or by **day of the year**. In the graph we made previously, we looked at the AQI index for each **day of year**. But, if you'd like, you can combine the data and look at it by **month**. 

Choose which one you prefer and **press** run code below. 

::: panel-tabset
## View data by MONTH

```{webr-r}
xvar = 'Month'
```

## View data by DAY OF YEAR

```{webr-r}
xvar = 'DOY'
```

:::

### Step 3: Add labels

Now let's add labels to your tile plot. 

Type in names for your labels below. Replace the red lines and keep the quotes `""`. 

The `xlabel` is the label for the bottom axis. 

The `ylabel` is the label for the left axis. 

The `title` goes on the top of the graph. 

**Type** your labels below. 

**Press** run code.

```{webr-r}
xlabel = "_____"

ylabel = "_____"

title = "_____"

```


### Step 4: Choose your category levels

The EPA has defined category levels for air quality (good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, hazardous). But maybe, you want to adjust those categories. For example, you might be extra sensitive to air pollution, so you want the "good" category to be smaller. Here, you have the option to define those categories. 



Now let's make your graph! 

**Press** run code below to see your graph. If you want to know more about how the code works, click "Learn more"!

aqi_colors<- setNames(object=myColors, nm=colLabels)


myCountyData<- usa_aqi_data|>
  filter(county.Name==myCounty) |>
  mutate(Year=format(as.Date(Date), "%Y"),
        Month = factor(month(Date)),
         DOY = yday(Date))|> 
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels= colLabels))
  
  ggplot(myCountyData, aes_string(x = xvar, y = "Year", fill = "Category"))+
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=aqi_colors, drop=FALSE)+
  labs(x=xlabel, y="Year", title=paste0("AQI levels for ", myCounty))
```

## Other options to learn more

After graphing, you may have some more questions! In the tabs below, there is some code you can run to learn more about your data and hopefully answer some of those questions. 

::: panel-tabset

## Look at your raw data

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Open this blue box first!

**Press** run code to see your raw data! 

It might be very large, so you can click the blue rectangle again to close the data. 

```{webr-r}
myCountyData
```

:::

## View multiple counties at once

Want to combine county data? 

**Replace** the red lines with your county names! Make sure you enclose them with quotes `""` and spell their names properly (refer back to [this table](#sec-choosecounty)).

**Press** run code

```{webr-r}
myCounty = "Clackamas" 
myCounty2 = "Multnomah"

```

Now, let's make the graph again:

```{webr-r}

myCountyData<- usa_aqi_data|>
  filter(county.Name==myCounty | county.Name==myCounty2) |>
  mutate(Year=format(as.Date(Date), "%Y"),
        Month = factor(month(Date)),
         DOY = yday(Date))|> 
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels= colLabels))
  
  ggplot(myCountyData, aes_string(x = xvar, y = "Year", fill = "Category"))+
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=aqi_colors, drop=FALSE)+
  labs(x=xlabel, y="Year", title=paste0("AQI levels for ", myCounty, " and ", myCounty2))
```

## Choose year limits

THIS DOESN"T WORK YET... MAYBE WILL NEED TO JUST DELETE

Would you like to focus on a specific set of years? To do this, we'll add limits for the year.

**Type** a year below. Replace the red line. 

**Press** Run code

```{webr-r}
lowerLimit = "________"

upperLimit = "______"

```

Example: 

```{webr-r}
lowerLimit = "2015"

upperLimit = "2023"

```

Now, we can run the graph code again: 

**Press** run code

```{webr-r}

myCountyData<- usa_aqi_data|>
  filter(county.Name==myCounty) |>
  mutate(Year=format(as.Date(Date), "%Y"),
        Month = factor(month(Date)),
         DOY = yday(Date))|> 
  mutate(Category = factor(Category, levels= colLabels))
  
  ggplot(myCountyData, aes_string(x = xvar, y = "Year", fill = "Category"))+
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=aqi_colors, drop=FALSE)+
  labs(x=xlabel, y="Year", title=paste0("AQI levels for ", myCounty))
```
