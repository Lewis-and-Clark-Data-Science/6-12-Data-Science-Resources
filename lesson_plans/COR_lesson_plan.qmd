**Objectives**:

-   Understand the importance and applications of data analysis in various fields.
-   Learn how to use R for basic data analysis
-   Analyze planetary data (mass, radius, surface gravity) using R.

**Materials Needed:**

-   The [dataset](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/lesson_code_zips/CORLessonCode.zip) for planetary data (in .csv format).
-   Projector or smartboard for demonstrating R operations.
-   [Printed worksheets](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/lesson_links/COR/COR%20gravity%20surface%20area.docx) from the previous discussion for each student.
-   [Lesson Slides](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/lesson_links/COR/COR LC presentation.pptx)
-   Also check out the other [materials](COR_lesson.qmd#sec-materials) on our overview page for broader unit materials you can include in your lessons. 

**Lesson Outline:**

1.  Introduction to Data Analysis (10 minutes)

    -   Briefly discuss what data analysis is and its importance in different fields (science, business, etc.).
    -   Highlight how data analysis helps in making informed decisions by understanding trends and patterns.

2.  Applications of Data Analysis (5 minutes)

    -   Provide examples of data analysis in astronomy, such as analyzing planetary data to understand celestial bodies.
    -   Mention real-life applications, like weather forecasting, understanding climate change, or space missions.

3.  Introduction to R (5 minutes)

    -   Introduce R as a powerful tool for data analysis.
    -   Pull up RStudio on [posit.cloud using this link](https://posit.cloud/content/6224821) or on Rstudio desktop and upload [this file](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/lesson_code_zips/CORLessonCode.zip)
        -   We recommend using posit.cloud because students can access R and the files directly on their computer. 
    -   Show the Studio interface and explain the different panels (console, script, environment, and files).

4.  Loading and Viewing Data in R (5 minutes)

    -   Demonstrate how to load the planetary data using `read.csv()`.
    -   Use commands like `head()`, `summary()`, and `str()` to view and understand the data structure

5.  Working on the Worksheet (10 minutes)

    -   Hand out the [printed worksheets](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/files/lesson_links/COR/COR%20gravity%20surface%20area.docx) (from the previous discussion).
    -   Students will use R to calculate the surface gravity and mass over surface area ratio for each planet, filling in the worksheet.

6.  Worksheet Discussion and Q&A (5 minutes)
      
    -   Discuss the findings from the worksheet.
    -   Encourage students to ask questions about the analysis process or any difficulties they encountered.


**Reflection:**

Conclude by asking students to reflect on how understanding data analysis can contribute to various scientific discoveries.
