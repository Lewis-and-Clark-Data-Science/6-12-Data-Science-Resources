**Lesson Title**: Air Quality Index

**Lesson Description:**

The goal of the lesson was to demonstrate air quality trends in different regional settings and examine how environmental factors can impact the Air Quality Index (AQI) using data science. Students had exposure to R, a data visualization language, to show them how to take large data sets and turn them into graphs that are easier to understand. We showed them how Posit Cloud is used through coding in a whole group demonstration, then used EPA data to compare air quality trends between Portland and Los Angeles in the last two decades. In groups, they looked at handouts of the EPA Tile Plots to practice searching for patterns and trends and critically analyze mistakes of data visualization. Finally, students used AQI data to write argumentative letters to support claims made about community impacts on air quality.

**Data Science in the Lesson:**

Working with raw data:

-   Students did not work with the raw data. They looked at the large data set and watched a demonstration of coding to analyze data.

Data visualization:

-   Yes, students compared the EPA scatterplots of AQI in Portland vs LA. The student takeaways were searching for patterns and trends, comparing regional data sets, and critically analyzing mistakes of data visualization.

Coding involved:

-   Students saw computer code. They observed a demonstration of R/Positcloud coding. The demonstration included a preliminary example of sorting Star Wars characters into categories to demonstrate how to manipulate a large data set. Then students watched a demonstration of the process of uploading a large AQI data set and using it to create graphs to answer relevant questions.
    -   Note: this lesson was originally taught with the assistance of undergraduate students who  demonstrated coding. If you have not coded before and would like to incorporate basic data science/coding into your lesson, refer to the [online AQI tutorial](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/tutorials/AQI_tutorial.html) for an easy walk-through you can use to demonstrate data science in your classroom!

### Reflection from teachers who have done this lesson

**What worked well? Why?**

-   Asking students to compare the air quality graphs of Portland and LA went really well. They understood the data visualization and how the EPA had incorrectly graphed the data. Having students test different factors that change air quality with the Atmotubes was also successful. Students really liked  trying out different factors like Clorox cleaning wipes or whiteboard markers with the Atmotubes because they could test different things and see the resulting numbers on the app. 

**What do you feel was missing?**

-   I would have given students little papers with questions to answer during the videos so that they stayed engaged. I might have had students compare the 2 graphs in small groups and then discuss the differences as an entire class.

**What changes would you make to future iterations? Why?**

-   In the future, I would want someone to help make a preset code that made the corrected graphs of the EPA air quality data so that students could copy that code and get to see the correct graphs on their screen. Then students could discuss the differences with their groups and why the two versions of graphs are different. Instead of watching someone else do this part, I am wondering if it would feel more authentic if students discovered the mistake on their own.
    -   Note: we have updated the lesson since this feedback, and now there is an opportunity for students to make the graphs themselves. See [the online AQI coding tutorial](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/tutorials/AQI_tutorial.html)
    -   Also check out [this coding activity](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/lesson_plans/mini_lessons.html#sec-pretend_computers) which incorporates moving around the classroom and pretending to be computers in order to introduce coding to students. 

**What do you believe are some of your students' major takeaways from this lesson?**

-   Students learned that the ProLogis company was planning to build a truck warehouse across the street from their school. The students on the track team were very concerned about their lungs being affected by large amounts of exhaust. Students with asthma were concerned for their safety. The biggest takeaway was learning that different factors can change the air around them and that it will have an effect on their health. Students were also able to compare the graphs of Portland vs Los Angeles and also the corrected graphs made by coding.
