**Lesson Title:** Sea Level Change

**Lesson Description:**

Students will apply what they have learned about kinetic molecular theory and apply their knowledge to the phenomenon of sea level rise as a result of thermal expansion of ocean water. This lesson takes place over \~2.5 class periods (block schedule of 95 minutes each) as a capstone in a basic unit in a Kinetic Molecular Theory Chemistry Unit. This lesson introduces data science to students, coding using R to produce data visualizations from large data sets, and asks students to interpret visualizations and ask questions. Following instruction on thermal expansion of ocean water, students will select a site of interest and work individually or with a partner to develop an informative project that demonstrates an understanding of KMT, thermal expansion, sea level change, climate change, and impacts to their chosen community.

**Data Science in the lesson:**

Although students do not directly work with raw data, they see a large data set and are exposed to the code to specifically choose one section from the larger data set. They are then guided through what code might look like to create specific types of graphs, such as scatter plots and bar charts. This exposure was planned with the intention for students to understand the ‘behind the scenes’ actions that go into creating visualizations, and to acknowledge which types of graphs are better to represent different types of data.

### Examples of Student Work

Based on the convergence of the curriculum and the data science lesson, students were assigned a choice of projects:

### Reflection from teachers who have taught this lesson

**What worked well? Why?**

-   Students learned about data science and career opportunities using coding & data
-   Students learned how to locate data and appropriate visualizations support claim

**What do you feel was missing?**

-   Interactive components for coding
    -   Note: Since recieving this feedback, we've added the [interactive code tutorial](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/tutorials/sealevel_tutorial.html)
-   More opportunities for students to engage with data sets to create new visualizations. Find resources to support this process
-   Have specific locations pre-selected with data sets and have students generate data visualizations

**What changes would you make to future iterations? Why?**

-   If we were to continue this project and teach it again in the future, we would rethink the structure of the lesson to allow space for more interactive components. Should there be more time and excess support, we could include a section where students can actually code something themselves and directly interact with the coding platform. We might also include a segment explaining how to find data sets, and how they are actually collected, going more into the behind-the-scenes of how data is collected.
    -   Note: Since recieving this feedback, we've added the [interactive code tutorial](https://lewis-and-clark-data-science.github.io/6-12-Data-Science-Resources/tutorials/sealevel_tutorial.html)

**What do you believe are some of your students' major takeaways from this lesson?**

-   Major student takeaways were understanding that data banks contain massive quantities of information, coding is a tool that can be used to create data visualizations, and data visualizations can be used to support claims. Students also learned information about how to read and interpret data visualizations.
