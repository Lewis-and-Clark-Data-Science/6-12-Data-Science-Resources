**Lesson Title:** Sea Level Change

**Lesson Description:**

Students will apply what they have learned about kinetic molecular theory and apply their knowledge to the phenomenon of sea level rise as a result of thermal expansion of ocean water. This lesson takes place over ~2.5 class periods (block schedule of 95 minutes each) as a capstone in a basic unit in a Kinetic Molecular Theory Chemistry Unit. This lesson introduces data science to students, coding using R to produce data visualizations from large data sets, and asks students to interpret visualizations and ask questions. Following instruction on thermal expansion of ocean water, students will select a site of interest and work individually or with a partner to develop an informative project that demonstrates an understanding of KMT, thermal expansion, sea level change, climate change, and impacts to their chosen community. 

**Data Science in the lesson:**

Although students do not directly work with raw data, they see a large data set and are exposed to the code to specifically choose one section from the larger data set. They are then guided through what code might look like to create specific types of graphs, such as scatter plots and bar charts. This exposure was planned with the intention for students to understand the ‘behind the scenes’ actions that go into creating visualizations, and to acknowledge which types of graphs are better to represent different types of data.
